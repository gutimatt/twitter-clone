# Twitter Clone

This pulls data from twitter using their API to find most recent post based on a search

Warning: Since Version 2 from Twitter API, this repo api has been deprecated.

## What I Learned 
* Twitter version 1 API
* Fromatting different mediums from json response into front end.  Examples include text, video, and images.

## Future Implementations
* Connect to Twitter v2
* Error handling

## Initalization

Run the server: 

```
cd pwj-twitter-clone-api-master
cd api-exercise
npm install
nodemon app.js
```
This will start listening on your local port 3000
